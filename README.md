  <!-- # Listen up, mortals 🧪

*"I'm gonna need you to take your slow, bloated code and shove it waaaaay up your... repository."*

Look, I don't have time to explain why your framework choice is terrible, but I'll build you something that actually works.

I'm a **systems enthusiast** who builds things the right way:
- ⚡ **Lightning fast**
- ⚙️ **Elegantly modular** 
- 💅 **Beautifully engineered**

If it's **low-level**, **performance-tuned**, or **aesthetic as hell**, I'm obsessed with it.

*No shortcuts. No compromises. No exceptions.*

## 🔥 What Drives Me

The intersection of **performance** and **beauty**:
- 🛠️ Crafting **efficient tools** that make dev workflows feel like magic
- 🧩 Building **modular architectures** with clean, well-documented code *(I actually write good comments)*
- 🎨 Designing **gorgeous Linux environments** — Hyprland, Waybar, and customized Neovim in perfect harmony
- ⚡ **Zero-compromise performance** — because milliseconds matter

I don't just code. I **engineer experiences**.

## 🚀 Currently Crafting

- ⚙️ **Blazing-fast CLI tools** in Go & Rust *(because waiting is for compilers)*
- 📦 **API-first architectures** with TypeScript, Node.js, and React/Next.js
- 🎨 **Minimal, aesthetic Linux rices** with Hyprland & Waybar
- ✨ **Neovim configurations** that feel like coming home

> *"Morty, greatness isn’t some microwave meal you zap for 30 seconds. It’s a slow-cook disaster – full of failures, cronenberg dimensions, and maybe a little interdimensional whiskey. But every screw-up? That’s just part of the recipe. So to everyone who says we can’t make it – physics, the Galactic Federation, your dad – we’ll show them what greatness looks like… one chaotic experiment at a time."*

### Ik-cyber

I build fast, clean systems and tools that work beautifully.

Currently working on CLI tools in Go & Rust, API architectures with TypeScript/Node.js, and crafting minimal Linux environments.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/Ik-cyber)
- [Email](mailto:numterminal@gmail.com)

I focus on performance-first development and elegant system design.

You might know me from:
- Building blazing-fast CLI utilities
- Crafting modular TypeScript architectures  
- Linux rice configurations with Hyprland
